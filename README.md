# Churn-Reduction-Using-Logistic-Regression
Acquiring new customers costs more than maintaining current customers. When a current
customer is lost, we lose future revenue and also the resources and investment that was
spent to acquire that customer.
# Objective
* Our goal is to create a logistic regression model that accurately predicts the potential churn of
customers (true positives) and has minimum misidentifications (false positives).
* Once the customers who are most likely to churn are identified, a targeted approach can be used
to address the factors that most influence churn.
